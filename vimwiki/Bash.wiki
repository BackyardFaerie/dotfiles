# Time Saving Shortcuts
1: History can take relative values to refer to commands from newest to oldest
	<code>history -4</code> <---runs fourth last command
	
2: ! can search previous commands via string as below
	<code>!ap</code> <---would run <code>apt update</code> assuming there were no other commands starting with <code>ap</code> more recently (like <code>apt-search cache</code>)
	
3: Caret can be used to replace text (e.g fix spelling mistake) or run the same command in the same dir but a slightly different option
	<code>apt updtae
	$ ^tae^ate</code> <---format is <code>^</code>string<code>^</code>replacement</code>

	<code>vim path/to/file1
	$ ^file1^file2</code> (could also be <code>^</code>1<code>^</code>2)

4: Ctrl+U to clear prompt ^(actually deletes everything before cursor)^, Ctrl+K removes everything after cursor ^(in Vim mode these binds work in normal mode)^

5: Make Terminal Use Vim Mode Keybinds
	<code>set -o vim</code>
^Starts in insert mode unlike actual Vim, use ESC as usual to go to normal mode and navigate^

6: In Vim mode d0 to delete from beginning of line to cursor, d$ to delete from cursor to end of line and dd to delete entire line

7: Ctrl+J enters new line, useful for quickly going back to input if scrolled up
