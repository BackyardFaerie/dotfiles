1: Fully Qualified Commands
Provide the full command path in scripts
Use `/usr/bin/echo "text"` instead of `echo "text"`
^This is because the `$PATH` var can be different for different distros, shell instances and generally full paths make the script more explicit and easier to debug^
^Having another program called `echo` for instance, can also perform any action which might be nefarious. Specifying the `/usr/bin` path reduces the chances of the script using the wrong commands^
