1: Open New File in Same Buffer (Workaround)
<code> :e thefile | bd# </code> // open file 'thefile' then clear previous buffer, effectively open a new file in current buffer

2: Encrypt file within Vim when accessing file
	<code>:X</code>
	
3: Decrypt file within Vim when accessing file
	<code>:set key=</code> <---blank after = to make passkey nothing
	
4: Open file in split
	<code>Ctrl+W gf</code>
	
5: Open file in vertical split
	<code>Ctrl+W vgf</code>

6: Jump down/up between line wrap
	<code>gj/gk</code>
	
7: Open new file in different buffer (open 2+ files simultaneously)
	<code>:ed filename/path</code>
^Where the path is needed if it is different from the currently open file (e.g ../file_in_parent_dir)^
